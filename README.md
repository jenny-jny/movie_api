# MyFlix Movies REST API
Latest update: 06.29.2021

## Project Description
The server-side component of a “movies” web application,including the server, business logic, and business layers of the application, and interacts with a database that stores data. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way.
